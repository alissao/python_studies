sentiment analysis from twitter to Fatec's Class

to use this, you just need to add a config.py file in the project with your Twitter API credentials:
consumer_key = "Your consumer key"
consumer_secret = "Your consumer secret"
access_token = "Your access token"
access_token_secret = "Your access token secret"

And then, the main.py file will utilize those variables to access twitter data and return what you need.
